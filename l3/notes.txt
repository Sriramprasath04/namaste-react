npm
    >> npmjs.com (official site)
    >> npm is a package manager (not Node Package Manager)

    >> Initializing npm to our project
            npm init (or) npm init -y
       after Initialization of npm it creates a "package.json" (configuration file) 

The most important package in our project is the "bundler"(web-pack, parcel, ...)
    There are 2 types of dependency
        1) Dev-dependency 
            -> It is required in the development phase
        2) Normal dependency 
            -> It is used in the production

    To install the dependency in our project use the command
        >> npm install -D parcel

npx
    >> It executes our package
        npx parcel src
            src -> (index.html)
