First React App
---------------

( using CDN links )
2 links are there 
    > - React (core) link -> creating elements
            const heading = React.createElement('tag-name', 'object', 'child-elements');
                obj -> used to give attributes to our class in key:value pair
                    {class : "heading", xyz:"abc" }
      - Creating the below structure us  ing React
        
            <div id="parent">
                <div id="child">
                    <h1>This is h1 tag</h1>
                    <h2>This is h2 tag</h2>
                </div>
            </div>

            const parent = React.createElement("div", {id:"parent"}, 
                React.createElement("div", {id:"child"}, [
                    React.createElement("h1", {}, "This is h1 tag"),
                    React.createElement("h2", {}, "This is h2 tag"),
                ])
            );

            const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
            root.render(parent);     
    
    >  * ReactDOM link -> for creating root and rendering things inside it
            const root =  React.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
       * Then we have to render the element that we created in the previous line
            root.render(heading);
         when we render things the conent inside it getting replaced by the new 
         rendering things.

------------------------------------------------
Note: 
    * The React.createElement cerates a react-element(Object) which after rendering 
      will be then converted to HTML.
            react-element(Object) => HTML
    * Order of filed matters a lot
      i.e, the CDN script files which should be the abouve the script app.js file 
      which uses it.
    * When the root is rendered it does not affect things outside it

Library vs Framework
********************
Library:
    > It can be applied to only to a specific portion of the page (side-bar, header, footer...)
    > It can work indepentently on a specific portion

Framework:
    > It comes with all loads of packages things with it, It should be applied as a whole
    > Predefined things
